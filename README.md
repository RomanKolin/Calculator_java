This is a calculator 
that can perform algebraic (addition/subtraction/multiplication/division, square/n-root, the second/third/n-degree, factorial/double factorial, base/decimal/natural logarithm)
and trigonometric (sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, arcsine, arccosine, arctangent, arccotangent) operations.
Also the above operations (except factorials and inverse trigonometric functions) with constant Ï€ and e are possible.
There are sign change and percent of the number.

There are four memory button (M+, M-, MR, MC). The remembered number is displayed above the main app field.

The cursor control are implemented in app.

Data in the main field and the memory field are saved when exiting the app.

This app can perform mathematical operations with two numbers or with one number.
